<h2> About Me </h2>
<p>
My name is Prince Ghosh and this seeks to serve as my personal website. I'm 22, and currently live in Cleveland, Ohio.
<br><br>
I grew up in South Brunswick, New Jersey and got two undergraduate degrees in Mechanical Engineering & Aerospace Engineering
from <a href="https://case.edu">Case Western Reserve University.</a>
<br><br>
I'm the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.boundarylabs.io">Boundary Labs</a>.
We're building a manufacturing workflow software startup based out of Cleveland, Ohio - moving soon to Mountain View, California.
<br><br>
I consider myself to be a voracious consumer of information; I love to read about science, policy, planes,
economics, strategy, data, tennis, and occaasionally, the intersection of all of the aformentioned.
<br><br>
I sometimes write on <a href="https://twitter.com/princeghosh97">Twitter</a> &
and <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Prince-Ghosh-2">Quora</a>, respectively.
